\section*{Exercise 5}
Does Language $ L = \{ aa^Rb : a, b \in \{0,1\}^* \land b,a \neq \epsilon \} $ is regular? 
Note that $a^R$ means reversing letters in $a$

\subsection*{Solution}
We will solve the question by contradiction, so let's assume $L$ is regular  \newline
By \textbf{Lemma 1}, if $L$ is regular then $L^R = \{ ba^Ra : b, a \in \{0,1\}^* \land b,a \neq \epsilon \}$ is also regular.  \newline
Let's pick $p$ from \textit{pumping lemma}. If $ 2 \nmid p $, then let $p := p+1$, to be able to divide by 2. We can also pick word $w = 0(10)^p(01)^p$. \newline
We see that $w \in L^R$ and $|w| \geq p$. Note that $|w| = 4p+1$\\
Because of it we can use \textit{pumping lemma} and $w = xyz$ such that 
\begin{itemize}
    \item $|y| \geq 1$
    \item $|xy| \leq p$
    \item $(\forall n \geq 0)(xy^nz \in L^R)$
\end{itemize}
Consider $xy^0z = xz$ for any $x$ and $y$\\
As  $|xy| \leq p$ we are sure that $xz = C(10)^{\frac{p}{2}}(01)^p$ for some $C \in (0|1)^p$, 
because we cannot delete characters with index higher than p. 
Note that $|xz| \leq 4p$, because $|y| \geq 1$ and $|w| = |xyz| = 4p+1$\\
We know that $xz \in L^R \iff \exists a,b \neq \epsilon: xz = ba^Ra \iff \exists a,b \neq \epsilon: C(10)^{\frac{p}{2}}(01)^p = ba^Ra$\\
Let's consider connection of $a^R$ and $a$. We can see that it has to contain two the same symbols next to each other, 
thus it cannot be in $(01)^p$ part. \\
But if end of $a^R$ is in the end of $(10)^{\frac{p}{2}}$ part or on previous indexes, then \\$|a| >= 2p$ and $|ba^Ra| \geq 1 + 2a + 2a = 1+4a > |xz| $.
So we cannot find suitable place for connection between $a^R$ and $a$, thus $xz \notin L^R$, which is contradiction.\\
Thus $L$ is not regular.
